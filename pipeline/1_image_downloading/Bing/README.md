# Bing Downloader

Downloads multiple images from Bing. Uses the Bulk Bing Image Downloader from
https://github.com/ostrolucky/Bulk-Bing-Image-downloader

## Arguments (edit in script)
* `items` - The list of items to grab images from. Use underscores instead of spaces,
because this will become the folder name those images will go into
* `transparent` - True or False, if you want transparent backgrounds or not
* `limit` - The higher the number, the more images you'll get. The number you insert is the MAXIMUM amount of images you might get per item.

Images will output to the downloads foler in their respective folder names.

We download the Bulk Bing Image Downloader in this script to prevent copy/pasting someone else's code in our repo.
