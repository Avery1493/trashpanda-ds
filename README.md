# Downloading Images

This hosts the google-images-download python program detailed from [here](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download)

## Current State

currently a `test.py` exists which will return a single image of a tire with a transparent background (see hardcoded arguments therein). This is saved to the `downloads` directory in another subdirectory named "tire"

## Future TODO's

Once a list of desired images are compiled, this list needs only to be added to the argument.
