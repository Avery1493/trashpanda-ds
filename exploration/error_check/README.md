# Error Checking

`error_check.py`

Checks for the presence of image files without corresponding text files and vice versa, as well as any other "random" filetypes present.

Can be implemented after new image files are downloaded (after resizing if applicable, but before re-naming or messing with the heavier background-editing scripts)
